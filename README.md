# PersonalWebsitePart3

Made this personal website in a week! Learned React.js and Next.js to make it. Used Chakra UI to implement the features on the website.

Comments on each component and file in pages explain what each part does. Documentation on Chakra's website helped the most in making this website. Most of the react stuff behind the scenes is setup by default.
